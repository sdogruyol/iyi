    # Measures what a compile costs when the prelude has already been analysed,

    #
    # The parent runs the top-level passes over the prelude alone and forks. The
    # child then compiles the user program against a `Program` that already has
    # the prelude in it, so restoring the prelude costs it a `fork` — around a
    # millisecond, a floor no serialised `.iyimod` can beat. The child's elapsed
    # time is therefore the ceiling of the whole `.iyimod` idea, obtainable
    # without designing the format.
    #
    # Front-end only: the child stops after semantic analysis. Codegen and
    # linking are LLVM's and the linker's problem, and `.iyimod`'s object-code
    # section addresses them separately.
    #
    # Known limit: compiling the compiler itself still fails under both models —
    # a `NilAssertionError` in `add_instance_var_initializer` under the artifact
    # model, and an error during the top-level pass under the full one. The
    # split runs `TypeDeclarationProcessor` twice, and part of its work is
    # global rather than per-tree, so the second run does not see everything the
    # first established. The nine smaller programs in the gate do not exercise
    # that. This is the next thing to fix before the probe becomes a build
    # daemon, and it is a real defect rather than a measurement caveat.
    #
    # Set IYI_FORK_TRACE=1 to see how far the child gets, and
    # IYI_FORK_SELFTEST=1 to check the runtime facilities a build needs (file
    # write, flock, subprocess) before it starts.
    #
    # Two models, because they answer different questions:
    #
    # * `IYI_FORK_PROBE=1` — the artifact exactly as Part IV describes it. The
    #   parent runs only the *top-level* passes over the prelude, so the child
    #   still walks the combined tree in every pass after that, and three passes
    #   still walk the whole type graph. That residual is the work a `.iyimod`
    #   would not remove on its own.
    #
    # * `IYI_FORK_PROBE=full` — the artifact *plus* prelude-aware passes. The
    #   parent analyses the prelude completely and the child touches only its
    #   own nodes. This prices IV.1a's third row: what the later passes would
    #   have to become for the front end to reach its floor.
    #
    #   It is 10× faster than the artifact model on the small programs in the
    #   gate, where it also reports what a normal compile reports and emits an
    #   object with an identical symbol table.
    #
    #   It does not work on real code, and the reason is structural rather than
    #   incidental: analysing the prelude *through `main`* and then declaring new
    #   types into it re-enters machinery that assumes declaration precedes
    #   typing. Subclassing a prelude type is enough to trip it — see SPEC.md
    #   IV.1e. Part IV's artifact carries types and signatures, not typed method
    #   bodies, so this model measures more than `.iyimod` restores. Treat its
    #   numbers as a ceiling on a configuration that does not work.
    #
    #   One trap, because it looks like a soundness failure and is not. Give
    #   codegen only the user tree and it dies with:
    #
    #     Missing __crystal_raise_overflow function
    #
    #   That is a `fun` in `src/raise.cr`, and codegen emits `fun`s and top-level
    #   code by walking the AST — so the prelude's tree has to reach codegen no
    #   matter what the front end did with it. That is the artifact's
    #   object-code section, not its analysis cache: the two need the prelude for

    # the cost and never was; three of them come out between 0.009 s and
    # 0.023 s. The driver and its scanner are 0.11 s of every build.

    # build's objects go.
