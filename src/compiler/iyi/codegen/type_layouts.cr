# iyi: the pass that turns the lowered types into pointer maps, which the
# `Layouts` section of a `.iyimod` carries (GC_DESIGN.md Stage 1).
#
# The collector this feeds never discovers an object's shape at run time: the
# compiler knows which words in an object are pointers, and this is where that
# knowledge is written down. Heap-layout precision is the one REQUIREMENT
# SPEC.md II.5 makes, and it is cheap precisely because the table is computed
# here, beside the typer that lowered the type.
#
# Every byte offset is LLVM's data layout answering about the emitted struct,
# never field sizes added up by hand. Padding and alignment are the target's
# business, and a hand-summed map that gets them wrong misses fields silently,
# which is the one failure a pointer map must not have.
#
# The walk below classifies each field: a reference, a `Pointer(T)`, a proc's
# context word, or an inline aggregate to recurse into. Where the exact shape
# is runtime business (a union's live arm, a C union's overlap), the map marks
# every word the field could put a pointer in. That asymmetry is the whole
# safety argument: over-marking retains an object too long, under-marking
# loses a live one.
#
# What is not here: a cross-module shape key. A generic that is not
# instantiated in this build has no layout to emit, and one entry serving two
# instantiations by shape is R-4's per-GC-shape keying, which nothing
# implements yet. `Type#gc_shape` exists and is not that key: it is a
# depth-bounded string built for a conservative measurement, collapsing
# pointers and references to one "PTR" and falling back to the exact type
# name at its depth limit. Fine for a lower bound, not fine as the identity
# of a pointer map. Its `pointer?` and `reference_like?` predicates, on the
# other hand, are exactly the distinction the walk below wants, and they are
# what it uses.
