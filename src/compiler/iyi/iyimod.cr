# iyi: `.iyimod`, the module artifact — SPEC.md Part IV.
#
# The contract: to compile module B which imports A, the compiler reads A's
# `.iyimod` and never opens A's source. Everything R-1 rests on is this file,
# and so is the measured win — the top-level pass costs 0.99 s today and 0.004 s
# when the prelude arrives pre-analysed (IV.1a).
#
# ## Shape
#
# A container with a section table, so a reader can take the sections it needs
# and seek past the rest. That is not tidiness: a consumer wants `Exports` and
# emphatically does not want to page in `ObjectCode` to get it, and the table is
# what makes skipping possible without parsing.
#
#     magic          "IYIMOD\0\0"

#     section count  u32
#     section table  { kind u16, padding u16, length u32 } * count
#     payloads       in table order
#
# Binary, for read speed (IV.1). Little-endian throughout, because the format is
# not portable between targets anyway — the header records a target triple and a
# reader rejects a mismatch.
#
# ## What is not here yet
#
# Every section named in `Section` is written now. An unknown one is skipped and
# a known one that is absent is simply absent, which is what the table is for.

  # first build.
  #
  # *interface* covers what a consumer typechecks against — the exports, the
  # `using` directives that resolve their annotations, and which modules this
  # one imports. A body is not in it, so editing one leaves every dependent's
  # own artifact valid.
  #

  # because it has to specialise them, and the module's initialiser, which is
  # spliced into the consuming program and runs there. IV.3 says a change here
  # need not make a dependent re-typecheck, only re-codegen; at module
  # granularity there is no way to say that, so a dependent that has one of
  # these edges is invalidated whole and told nothing finer.
  #
  # *source* is IV.3's Private — private types, ordinary bodies, everything
  # that is neither of the above. At module granularity that is the module's
  # own source text, which is also the thing that answers the first question a
  # cache has: does this artifact still describe the file it was written from.
  #
  # **Computed from the front end alone**, before codegen. An artifact written

  # struct and a trait and nothing else. There is no `enum` in the prelude or
  # in any sample, so nothing has asked (SPEC.md IV.2).
  #
  # *visibility* is what was written, and it is what keeps R-2b true on the far
  # side: a type carried without `pub` is declared by the consumer and reachable
  # from nowhere, which is exactly what it is when the module is read from
  # source. An unexported type travels at all because the module's own machine
  # code refers to it — `Array(Secret):type_id` is resolved from a definition in
  # the consuming program, and a program can only number a type it has.
  #
  # A type nobody may call travels as its name, its kind and its fields, and
  # its methods stay behind: the consumer has no way to reach them, and the
  # module's own object code already defines them. That is also why carrying
  # them would be worse than useless — R-2's block rule would start refusing
  # modules over a private method's unannotated block.
  #
  # For a trait, *methods* is what the trait requires and supplies — II.6's
  # abstract requirements and the signatures (not bodies) of its defaults,
  # which is what a consumer needs to check an impl against. For a struct or
  # class it is the exported methods declared on it.
  #
  # *assoc_types* is kept apart from *type_parameters* because II.6 keeps them
  # apart: a parameter is chosen by whoever implements the trait and an
  # associated type is answered by the impl. Both are type variables of the
  # same type internally, so a reader that merged them would ask an impl of
  # `Enumerable` to supply `Elem` at the `impl` line, which is the one place
  # II.6 says it does not go.
  #
  # *fields* is the type's own instance variables, `{"@items", "Array(T)"}`.
  #
  # An implementation detail that has to travel anyway, which IV.2 admits in as
  # much: a consumer allocates the type, and allocating needs its size. Left
  # out, a consumer read `pub struct List(T)` as a struct with no fields and
  # generated a `List(Int32)::new` that allocated nothing while the module's
  # own code wrote to `@items`. That is not a missing feature, it is memory
  # corruption waiting for the rest of `ObjectCode` to stop failing at link.
  #
  # Inherited fields are not here. They belong to the supertype's declaration,
  # and a consumer that has this type has that one too.
  # *types* is what this type declares in turn. A nested type belongs to its
  # container rather than to the module's surface (R-2 governs the unit's own
  # body), so it is rendered where it was written and carries the visibility it
  # was written with.
  #
  # *value* is what an `alias` is equal to, and it is empty for everything
  # else. An alias has neither a layout nor an id, and it travels anyway,
  # because a declaration that does names it: a carried record's `handler :
  # Handler` is the text the module was written with, and a consumer without

  # builds walked the same declarations in the same order, and nothing in the
  # format makes that true.
  #
  # The side was missing, and `Log` is written the way that finds it: a
  # `{% for %}` loop writes `def info(*, exception : Exception)` on the
  # instance and another writes `def self.info(*, exception : Exception)` on
  # the class. Same container, same name, same parameters, no block — one key,
  # and the second body took it. The consumer read `Log#info` as
  # `Top.info(exception: exception)`, which is `Log#info` calling itself, and
  # said `recursive block expansion: blocks that yield are always inlined`.
  # *ordinal* is which of several identical signatures this is, counting from
  # zero in the order they were written.
  #
  # One container may hold two definitions of one signature, and Crystal has a
  # word for reaching the earlier one: `previous_def`. `db` writes a macro that
  # redefines `around_query_or_exec` with a body calling the definition it
  # replaced, and keyed on the signature alone the second body took the first's
  # place — so the consumer read one definition whose body named a previous one
  # it did not have: `there is no previous definition of
  # 'around_query_or_exec'`.

    # can leave a boundary half-written, so only the step that starts it says

    # Whether this artifact's root is a *class* rather than a module.
    #
    # It decides one thing and it is structural: a module's declarations are
    # wrapped in a `module <path>` header, and for a class root that header
    # camelcases to the class's own name — so the class was declared *inside* a
    # module of the same name and every type under it gained a level.
    # `Widget::Part` became `Widget::Widget::Part`, and a consumer told to
    # number `Widget::Part` could not name it.
    #
    # A class root needs no header, because the class is the namespace. iyi's
    # parser wraps a file in its module only when a header is there, so leaving
    # it out puts the declarations where they belong — and a `ClassType` is a
    # `ModuleType`, so everything that looks a module unit up by name still
    # finds it.
    property class_root : Bool

    # Whether the module this artifact is of writes `extend self`.
    #
    # A `--crystal` boundary reopens a module of the other language, where a
    # module is a mixin: a module function is written `def self.` and an
    # instance method is not, and the header says nothing. iyi's own header
    # *is* `extend self`, so a boundary read under it put the module into its
    # own metaclass — `module Random` has `abstract def next_u` for its
    # includers to answer, and its metaclass answered nothing: `abstract def
    # Random#next_u() must be implemented by Random:Module`, on a program whose
    # only line was `import random`.
    #
    # So the header no longer supplies it and this carries it instead, which is
    # the honest place for it: whether a module extends itself is a fact about
    # the module. `module Shard; extend self; def make(...)` is a module
    # function on both sides of the boundary because of this line.
    #
    # True by default, because an artifact written by anything but `tool bind`
    # is a module of iyi's own and iyi's module header is `extend self`. Only
    # `tool bind` has a shard to ask, and it asks.
    property module_extends_self : Bool

    # Under `--crystal`, the library files this module required, in the order
    # it required them.
    #
    # A module compiled against Crystal's library is compiled against the types
    # that library defines, and its object code refers to them by name — a type
    # id, a constant, a method symbol. The consumer defines those names, and it
    # can only define the ones its own program has. A module that required
    # `uri` and a consumer that did not left `URI::Error.class:type_id`
    # undefined at link time: a name from a library the consumer had never
    # heard of, in an object file it did not compile.
    #
    # So the requires travel with the module and the consumer replays them,
    # which makes the consumer's program a superset of the producer's. The
    # *numbering* is still the consumer's — that is what `TypeIds` is for — so
    # this adds types rather than importing anybody else's ids.
