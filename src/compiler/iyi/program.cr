  # It also carries around all information needed to compile a bunch
  # of files: the unions, the symbols used, all global variables,
  # all required files, etc. Because of this, a Program is usually passed
  # around in every step of a compilation to record and query this information.
  #
  # In a way, a Program is an alternative implementation to having global variables
  # for all of this data, but modeled this way one can easily test and exercise
  # programs because each one has its own definition of the types created,
  # methods instantiated, etc.
  #
  # Additionally, a Program acts as a regular type (a module) that can have
  # types (the top-level types) and methods (the top-level methods), and which
  # can also include other modules (this happens when you do `include Module`
  # at the top-level).
