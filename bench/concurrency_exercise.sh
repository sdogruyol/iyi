# Drives bench/concurrency_exercise.iyi: the concurrency runtime's gate
# (SPEC.md III.4, built in III.4.8's order).
#
#     bash bench/concurrency_exercise.sh
#
# Four steps, and the last two are failure proofs, because a gate that
# cannot fail is not a gate:
#
#   1. The exercise holds every asserted property, plain and --release —
#      the release arm is not decoration: the context switch is naked asm,
#      and the optimiser is the thing that corrupted it until @[NoInline]
#      said not to.
#   2. The binary keeps the dependency floor (III.9): on Linux the runtime
#      is raw syscalls and must add zero undefined symbols; on darwin the
#      floor is libSystem and nothing else, held as the exact symbol list.
#   3. A deadlocked program — every fiber blocked, nothing to wake one —
#      exits 1 with the deadlock named, rather than hanging.
#   4. A group whose spelling would compile sequentially still interleaves:
#      step 1's first property, called out because III.4.8 refused the
#      sequential imitation by name; this step proves the check *can* fail
#      by asserting the exercise's own assert is reachable (a wrong
#      expected order exits 1).

# a libSystem symbol by design (III.9: raw syscalls are not a stable ABI
# there), so the floor is the exact list below plus libSystem as the one
# linked library; a new name is a dependency being taken on and belongs in
# this list in the commit that causes it.
