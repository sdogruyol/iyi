# Exercises Stage 3 root discovery, and proves the exercise can fail.
#
#     bash bench/root_exercise.sh
#
# GC_DESIGN.md's Stage 3 names the verification: "write a test that allocates
# objects and embeds pointers in global memory, stack, and registers; verify
# that manual root discovery finds them". `bench/root_exercise.iyi` is that
# program and this runs it.
#
# Five things happen here that the program cannot do for itself.
#
# It is built without `-Dgc_iyi`, which is the only way to know that a prelude
# carrying a root scanner still compiles for a program that does not want one.
#
# Every check's line is named below, because a build that silently compiled the
# whole section out would otherwise print nothing and exit 0, which reads
# exactly like a pass.
#
# The `-Dgc_iyi` binary's undefined symbols and libraries are audited the way
# `bench/dependency_floor.sh` audits a default build's, because root discovery
# asks the platform new questions and a new question can arrive as a new
# library.
#
# The Linux paths are cross-compiled and their objects audited. Root discovery
# is the first part of this collector whose code differs by platform in more
# than a syscall number: Linux reads `/proc/self/maps` and two linker symbols,
# darwin asks libSystem and walks a Mach header. A workstation runs one of
# them. Compiling the other, for both its architectures, is what says the
# inline assembly assembles and the symbols are the two expected ones, and it
# is stated as that rather than as a run.
#
# And the two mechanisms most likely to pass for the wrong reason are removed
# from a COPY of the prelude, which is then built against and must fail. A
# check that cannot fail is not a check. The copy is why nothing in the tree is
# touched to do it.
#
# Needs `make` for bin/iyi, plus `nm`, and `otool` on darwin or `readelf` on
# Linux. Exits non-zero if any check fails.

# Linux adds two undefined symbols and no library: `__data_start` and `_end`
# bound the static data, and both come from the link that is already happening,
# `_end` from the linker itself and `__data_start` from the C runtime object
# every link template adds. Reading `/proc/self/maps` costs nothing at all,
# because `openat`, `read` and `close` are raw syscalls there.
#
# darwin adds four, all libSystem's, which is the standing `write`, `mmap` and
# `munmap` already have on that platform: `pthread_self` and
# `pthread_get_stackaddr_np` for the stack base, and
# `_dyld_get_image_header` with `_dyld_get_image_vmaddr_slide` for the segment
# ranges. Apple documents libSystem as the interface and raw syscalls as not a
# stable ABI, so there is no rawer answer to reach for. The rest of the darwin
# list is every darwin program's — the poller, its clock and errno, which the
# panic path carries — plus one this program's own: `mprotect`, the guard
# page of the fiber it spawns. `bzero` was here for a day: the compiler
# zeroes every `Pointer.malloc` with an `llvm.memset`, the aarch64 back end
# lowers one it will not inline (the 1.5 MiB object below) to a `bzero`
# call, and the prelude now defines `bzero` the way it defines `memset`, so
# the call resolves to the program's own. The stale names (`malloc`,
# `memset`, `realloc`, the file calls) are gone from the list, because an
# entry nothing uses is a check without teeth.
