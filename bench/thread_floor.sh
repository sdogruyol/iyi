# Drives bench/thread_floor.iyi: what a kernel thread, and a stop-the-world
# over kernel threads, cost the dependency floor (SPEC.md III.9) — measured
# before the design that needs them (GC_DESIGN.md Stages 4, 7, 8, 9;
# SPEC.md III.4.7's `Share`) is written.
#
#     bash bench/thread_floor.sh
#
# Seven steps, and the last four are failure proofs, because a gate that
# cannot fail is not a gate:
#
#   1. The program holds every property, plain and --release (and on darwin
#      the three refused variants, release): N threads,
#      each with a tid of its own and a thread-local block of its own;
#      every one stopped where it ran by a signal and a handler that read
#      the thread's sp and pc out of the context and found the sp on that
#      thread's stack, released by one wake; every one joined; every
#      `@[ThreadLocal]` slot still its owner's at the end; the one word
#      every thread added to holding exactly the sum of their own.
#   2. The binary keeps the floor. This is the measurement the file exists
#      for, and it is asserted, not printed. On Linux: the runtime's five
#      C-template names and nothing else — a thread by raw `clone` adds no
#      symbol, a thread-local variable adds no `__tls_get_addr`, and the
#      prelude's `Atomic(T)` adds no `__atomic_*`. On darwin, where
#      III.9's rule is that every call is libSystem's: the exact list
#      below, which is the runtime's names plus what a thread costs there,
#      spelled out one by one.
#   3. The pause, by thread count, printed from real runs, and what one
#      touch of a `@[ThreadLocal]` costs against a plain class variable.
#      Reported rather than budgeted: a budget would be a number this
#      script made up, and the shape (how it scales past the core count)
#      is the finding.
#   4. The ran-its-loop assertion is reachable: a thread that counts into
#      the wrong word exits 1 at that check's own name.
#   5. The thread-local assertion is reachable. On Linux, `clone` without
#      CLONE_SETTLS leaves every thread on the main thread's block. On
#      darwin dyld lays the block out and there is no bit to drop, so the
#      `@[ThreadLocal]` annotation itself is dropped instead: the slots
#      become one thread's class variables and clash. Either way the
#      program exits 1 naming the thread-local that was not.
#   6. The held-context assertion is reachable: the context's sp read at
#      the pc's offset is not on any thread's stack, and the program exits
#      1 counting the handlers that read it.
#   7. The atomic is doing the counting: with a load and a store in place
#      of the prelude's `Atomic(UInt64).add` on the one word every thread
#      adds to, the sum comes up short and the program exits 1 naming how
#      many updates it lost.
