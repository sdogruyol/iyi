# Fails when iyi grows a dependency.
#
# Crystal requires thirteen libraries: libc, bdw-gc, libevent, compiler-rt,
# pcre2, gmp, iconv, openssl, libxml2, libyaml, zlib, LLVM and libffi. A program
# iyi builds must reach none of them, and the compiler must reach only the ones
# named below with a reason beside each. This checks it rather than asserting it
# (SPEC.md III.9, III.10).
#
#     bash bench/dependency_floor.sh
#
# Two layers, because either alone can be fooled. The symbol list catches a
# dependency arriving as a call into something the linker resolves from libc.
# The library list catches one arriving as a whole `-l`, which adds no undefined
# symbol a naive check would notice once it is satisfied. Two builds, plain
# and --release, because the optimiser can put a name on the line the plain
# build never had (`bzero` on darwin was one, for a day).
#
# A new entry is not automatically wrong. It is a dependency being taken on,
# which is a decision, and the way to record the decision is to add it here in
# the same commit that causes it. What this refuses is the version where a
# library arrives with a feature and nobody finds out until a build fails on a
# machine that does not have it.
#
# Needs `make` for bin/iyi, plus `nm` and `otool` on darwin or `nm` and
# `readelf` on Linux. Exits non-zero if any floor moved, in either direction: a
# floor that got lower with this script left behind stops having teeth.

# What a program iyi builds may leave undefined. On darwin these are libSystem's
# and there is no way around that: Apple supports libSystem as its only
# interface and raw syscalls are explicitly not a stable ABI, which is why Go
# links it there too. On Linux the prelude issues raw syscalls instead and adds
# no symbol of its own; what it does carry are five left undefined by the C
# runtime objects every link template adds (crt1.o, crti.o, crtbegin.o):
# __libc_start_main, __gmon_start__, __cxa_finalize and the two weak _ITM_
# references. They are the template's, not the prelude's. The list spells them
# the way `symbols()` reports them, with the ELF leading underscore stripped;
# `malloc` or `mmap` is not among them and would still fail, because that would
# mean the prelude fell back to libc. What the prelude ITSELF asks for is read
# one layer down, at the object, by the per-target audit in CI, where an iyi
# program's .o for x86_64-linux-gnu is empty.
# `read` joined the list when `samples/iyi/calc` started reading standard
# input: on darwin that is `LibC.read` for the same reason `write` is, and on
# Linux it is syscall 0 (63 on aarch64), so the Linux list is unchanged and
# `calc`'s x86_64-linux-gnu object still has zero undefined symbols.
# `open`, `close` and `chmod` joined when `File` did. Darwin binds libSystem;
# Linux issues `openat`/`close` as syscalls, so the Linux list is still
# unchanged and `files.iyi`'s x86_64-linux-gnu object is empty.
# `unlink` joined with File.delete. Darwin binds libSystem again; Linux issues
# `unlinkat`, so its undefined list and the files object remain empty.
# `kqueue`, `kevent`, `clock_gettime_nsec_np` and `__error` joined when the
# concurrency runtime (SPEC.md III.4.8) reached darwin arm64: the panic path
# runs through the scheduler, so every darwin program carries the poller and
# its clock, all of it libSystem for the same reason `write` is. Linux keeps
# raw syscalls, so its list and the per-target objects are unchanged.
# `mmap`, `munmap`, `pthread_self`, `pthread_get_stackaddr_np` and the two
# `_dyld_get_image_*` calls joined when the owned collector became the
# default (GC_DESIGN.md, the flip): the arena maps and unmaps through
# libSystem's VM interface, and root discovery asks libSystem for the stack
# base and dyld for the image's segments — the same standing `write` has.
# `malloc` and `realloc` LEFT the list with the same flip: a default darwin
# program allocates from the arena now, and a build that asks libSystem for
# malloc again is the regression this list exists to catch. `mprotect`
# appears only in a program that spawns a task, and no sample does;
# bench/concurrency_exercise.sh allows it for the exercise binary.
# `memset` LEFT with the same flip, which the gate's own tightness check
# demanded: the arena clears reused chunks with its own clear_block, so no
# darwin sample references libSystem's memset any more, and an allowlist
# entry nothing uses is a check without teeth.
# `_tlv_bootstrap` joined when the scheduler's state moved behind one
# `@[ThreadLocal]` pointer (concurrency.iyi, GC_DESIGN.md's thread cutover):
# Mach-O has no local-exec, so every thread-local descriptor names dyld's
# thunk, and every darwin program reaches the scheduler. Linux pays no name
# for the same variable, which is the thread floor's finding.
# `pthread_kill` joined with the runtime's kernel thread (thread.iyi, GC
# Stage 4): every darwin program's collector can stop a thread, and the
# stop's name is referenced whether or not the program ever starts one
# (the plain build keeps it; the optimiser drops it as unreachable with
# no thread to stop). Linux's stop is syscalls.
# `pthread_create` and `sysctlbyname` joined with the parallel marker
# (Stage 7): the collector starts its helpers as kernel threads of its own
# and sizes them by `hw.ncpu`. `pipe` joined with the concurrent mark
# (Stage 9): helper 0 takes the mark's second stop, which stops the main
# thread, so the main thread registers a line - and on darwin a line's park
# is a pipe - the first time a mark runs beside it, and `sigaction`
# joins with it, the stop's handler installed then. `madvise` is the
# sweep handing a run of dead pages back (`MADV_FREE_REUSABLE`, the
# advice darwin's accounting honours). Linux names none of the five:
# clone, sched_getaffinity, futex, rt_sigaction and madvise are syscalls.
