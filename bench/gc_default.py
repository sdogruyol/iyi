"""The default-allocator decision, measured before it is made.

The collector's own record says moving the default is "a measurement and a
decision, not a side effect", and this is the measurement. The same program,
iyi's own prelude, three allocators:

  * **default** — the owned collector, triggering itself by allocation
    pressure. It became the default on the strength of this file's own
    table.
  * **-Dgc_none** — the bump pointer: allocate, never free. The fastest
    path, the unbounded one, and the default this file retired.
  * **-Dgc_boehm** — libgc, the collector 0.1.0 shipped and the dependency
    the floor exists to refuse.

Two numbers per cell, because the flip trades them against each other: wall
time (best of five) and peak RSS (worst of the same five, read from the
kernel's own accounting via wait4). A row whose three outputs differ is
refused rather than reported.

    python3 bench/gc_default.py

What the workloads are for. `arithmetic` allocates nothing and is the
control: any spread there is noise or a trigger firing when it should not.
`live set` allocates and keeps everything: a collector pays its marks for
no reclaimed byte, which is its worst honest case. `churn` and `string
churn` allocate and drop: the bump pointer's RSS is the garbage itself,
and a collector's RSS is the live set — this is the case a default that
never frees cannot serve, and the reason the question exists.

Release builds. Run it on an idle machine.
