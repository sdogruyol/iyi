"""Fails when Crystal's name stands in for iyi's own.

iyi is a permanent fork. Crystal is the language it came from, not its
identity, so the name is allowed only where it genuinely denotes Crystal: the
standard library a `--crystal` program compiles against, the licence and
provenance, the compatibility binary, and upstream's documentation kept beside
ours. Everywhere else it is leakage, and leakage is what this refuses.

    python3 bench/identity_floor.py            # check
    python3 bench/identity_floor.py --list     # every unallowed occurrence

Two layers, because either alone is fooled. PATHS catches a whole tree that
should have been renamed. LINES catches a name inside a file that was otherwise
cut over, which is the shape a skipped hunk leaves behind.

A new match is not automatically wrong. It is a claim that this occurrence
denotes Crystal rather than iyi, and the way to make that claim is to add it
here, in the same commit, with the reason. What this refuses is the version
where the name creeps back and nobody notices.

This is written in Python rather than shell on purpose: the first draft used
`grep -P`, the `grep` on the PATH inside a script has no `-P`, and every
allowlist test errored and failed OPEN. A gate that cannot fail is worse than
no gate, so the matching is done here where the semantics are exact.
