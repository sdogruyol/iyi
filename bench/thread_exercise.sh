# Drives bench/thread_exercise.iyi: kernel threads under the collector —
# GC_DESIGN.md Stage 4, the stop-the-world, built (src/iyi/thread.iyi).
#
#     bash bench/thread_exercise.sh
#
# Six steps, and the last two are failure proofs, because a gate that cannot
# fail is not a gate:
#
#   1. The program holds every property, plain and --release, with eight
#      threads: each allocates from its own cache while collections run
#      from whichever thread crosses the budget; each holds a live list in
#      nothing but its own frames through those collections and finds it
#      intact, by checksum and by the sweep's own free flag; each runs
#      fibers of its own, one parked holding an object's only reference;
#      collections stopped threads; and the program finishes, which is the
#      proof no stop deadlocked on the runtime lock or on a thread inside
#      the allocator.
#   2. The binary keeps the floor. On Linux the runtime's five C-template
#      names and nothing else: a thread by raw `clone`, a stop by `tgkill`
#      and `rt_sigaction`, a park by `futex`, all syscalls. On darwin the
#      exact list: the runtime's names plus what a thread costs there,
#      the thread floor's list, spelled out.
#   3. The numbers, printed from the release run: allocations per thread,
#      collections, stops, and the wall time per allocation per thread at
#      1, 4 and 8 threads. Reported rather than budgeted.
#   4. The same, twice the cores' worth of threads, release — past the core count —
#      because a thread stopped while it has no CPU is the case the
#      floor's table said costs the timeslice, and the properties must hold
#      there too.
#   5. Failure proof: the thread-root walk removed from a copy of the
#      prelude, and a thread's list — reachable from its stopped frames
#      alone — is swept out from under it; the program exits 1 naming the
#      node on a free list.
#   6. Failure proof: a block that captures a value whose type is not
#      `Share` (SPEC.md III.4.4) does not compile, and the error names the
#      variable, its type and the field that made it mutable.
#
# Linux x86_64 and aarch64, darwin aarch64.
