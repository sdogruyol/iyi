# Build the LLVM the tarball links: static, minimal, and the same on every
# platform that ships one.
#
# This is Crystal's own recipe (distribution-scripts, omnibus's llvm
# software definition), recorded in 0.6.0's Learned entry and adopted
# once it was measured: `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` so the compiler carries
# LLVM inside itself, `MinSizeRel`, only the five targets the compiler
# reaches, and every optional dependency `OFF` — zlib, zstd, libxml2,
# ffi, z3, libedit — so the closure a shared libLLVM drags behind it
# (libedit, libxml2, libicu, libncursesw, libzstd; 179 MB of `lib/` on
# Linux, brew's whole LLVM keg on darwin) never comes into existence
# rather than being bundled well.
#
# One script and not one cmake line per CI job, because two copies of a
# recipe are two recipes the day one is edited. CI keys its cache on this
# file's hash, so editing the recipe *is* invalidating the cache; nothing
# has to remember to bump a version token.
#
# The archive must be built by the toolchain that will link it: a static
# archive is bound to the C++ runtime and libc it was compiled against,
# and one built on a newer machine is a link error or a silent
# binary-for-newer-glibc on this one. So each platform builds its own,
# and the cost — roughly an hour on a CI runner — is paid once per
# recipe change, not per push.
#
# Usage: build-static-llvm.sh <install-prefix>
#
# Needs cmake, a C++ toolchain, curl and a tar that reads xz; installing
# those is the caller's business because it differs per image.
