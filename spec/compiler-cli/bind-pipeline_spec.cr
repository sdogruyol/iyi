# iyi: a Crystal namespace bound, built, and called from an iyi program.
#
# Two commands and no binutils, which is the whole of what changed. What this
# used to take was four steps — compile the keep file to one object, read its
# symbols with `nm`, make them global with `objcopy`, then hand the object to
# the consumer — and it did not work at the end of it. The object `--emit obj`
# makes is a whole program: it carries Crystal's library with it, and a program
# can have that library once. Linked into a consumer with none, the shard's
# constants never initialise and the first read segfaults. Linked into one that
# has it, every runtime global is defined twice and nothing links.
#
# An ordinary build leaves one object per type instead, and the ones a namespace
# owns carry no runtime at all. `--emit-bind` on that build puts them in the
# artifact, and the consumer links what the artifact carries — which is what it
# already does for an iyi module's object code.
#
# `--crystal` on the consumer is not decoration. The unit numbers
# `Pointer(LibUnwind::Exception)` whatever the shard does, because a `String#+`
# can raise, and an iyi program cannot name that type.
