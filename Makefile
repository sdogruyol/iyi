# `\$$ORIGIN` and not `$$ORIGIN`: the bootstrap compiler runs its link command through a
# shell, so an unescaped token is expanded there and the binary is left

# fork, so the server half cannot be the multi-threaded binary. Same sources,
# same prelude path, `-Dwithout_mt` — and a name `iyi daemon start` will find
# beside itself, installed or in `.build`.

# iyi: the front end on its own. Linking libLLVM costs 26 ms of load-time
# initialisers whether or not anything generates code, and `--no-codegen` never
# calls it — so this links none and starts in 6 ms rather than 39 (SPEC.md
# 0.1.0, src/compiler/iyi/llvm_shim.cr).
#
# The host triple and the LLVM version are baked in from the compiler that has
# LLVM, because without it there is nothing to ask.
